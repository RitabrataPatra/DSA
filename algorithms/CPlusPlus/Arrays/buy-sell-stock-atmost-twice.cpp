//Question : Buy and Sell Stock atmost twice(advanced version of the question "best time to buy and sell stock" )

//Time Complexity : O(n)

//For each price in the list, update "min1" if the current price is lower, as it would be the best price to buy for the first transaction.

// Calculate the potential profit (curr1) from the first transaction by subtracting min1 from the current price. If this profit is higher than profit1, update profit1.


// For the second transaction, update "min2" by considering the cost of buying again after gaining the first profit. Calculate the potential profit (curr2) for the second transaction and update "profit2" if this profit is higher.
